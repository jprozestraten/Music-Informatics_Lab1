# Music-Informatics_Lab1
Frequency  analysis and feature detection

These are all the source-code files I used for Lab1.

In the main directory I also have the file 'road.wav' which is the sound file I
used for the signal processing part. You could also use any other .wav file, you
only have to change the name in 'frequencyanalysis.m'.

I also worked with only local files, so all kikibouba files are in folders in
this directory. It should look like this:

kikibouba_test/
  kiki/
    .wav
  bouba/
    .wav
kikibouba_train/
  kiki/
    .wav
  bouba/
    .wav
.m files
road.wav

The main scripts to run are 'frequencyanalysis.m', 'kikibouba.m', 'and
kikiboubatexture.m'

Loading the data from the all .wav files in kikibouba takes a
while.
